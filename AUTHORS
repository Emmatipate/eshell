Eshell was created by John Wiegley <johnw@newartisans.com> around April of
1999, when he was confined to working on Windows NT machines and wanted a
better eshell to work with -- all without having to leave the comforts of
Emacs.

Many people have contributed to Eshell since then.  Below are just some of the
names that appear in the version control log; those others who helped during
its very inception have been lost to time.

A special thanks, however, goes to Lee Cantey, who was my office time during
the time of Eshell's furious construction.  :-) We had many fun lunches were
he patiently listened to all of my new ideas as they were being born.
